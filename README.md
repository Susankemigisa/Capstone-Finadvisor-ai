## 🎓 Capstone Project Summary

> **AI Engineering Capstone — Case 2 (AI Agent for Task Automation) + Case 3 (Smart Document Search System)**

**FinAdvisor AI** is a full-stack AI-powered personal finance advisor built for the AI Engineering Capstone project. It addresses a real and widespread problem: access to quality, personalised financial guidance is deeply unequal. Certified financial planners are expensive and inaccessible to most people, while generic online tools do not account for a user's actual portfolio, income, goals, or personal documents.

FinAdvisor AI solves this by deploying a **LangGraph-powered AI agent** equipped with **32 specialised financial tools**, a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** for analysing the user's own uploaded financial documents, and **real-time market data** — all accessible through a conversational streaming chat interface. A user can ask *"Based on my last tax return, how much should I be saving each month?"* and the system will retrieve their document, fetch current data, run the appropriate calculations, and respond with a grounded, personalised answer — while always reminding the user it is an AI and not a licensed financial advisor.

The project implements **Case 2 (AI Agent for Task Automation)** as its primary case, with substantial overlap into **Case 3 (Smart Document Search)** through the full RAG pipeline and semantic document retrieval system. See [PRESENTATION.md](PRESENTATION.md) for the full SCR analysis and SMART goals, and [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) for the ethical considerations breakdown.

## 🤖 AI Agent & LangGraph Architecture

The core of FinAdvisor AI is a **LangGraph StateGraph** agent that orchestrates every chat turn. Rather than a simple prompt → response loop, each message passes through a structured pipeline of nodes:

```
START
  │
  ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   RAG Node  │  ← Retrieves relevant chunks from the user's uploaded documents
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   Planner   │  ← LLM call: decides what to say or which tools to call (ReAct)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├── needs confirmation? ──→ ┌──────────────────┐
       │                           │  Human Review    │  ← HITL interrupt (user must confirm)
       │                           └────────┬─────────┘
       │                                    │
       ├── tools needed? ──────────────────→ ┌──────────────┐
       │                                     │  Tool Node   │  ← Executes enabled tools only
       │                                     └──────┬───────┘
       │◄────────────────────────────────────────────┘
       │  (loops back to planner with tool results)
       ▼
      END
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **RAG runs first on every turn** — before the LLM is called, the RAG node checks whether the question is relevant to any uploaded document and injects matching chunks into context. This is a near-zero-cost no-op when no documents are present.
- **ReAct planning loop** — the planner LLM decides whether to respond directly or call tools. After tools execute, the planner is called again with results to formulate the final answer.
- **HITL interrupt** — using LangGraph's `interrupt_before` mechanism, the graph pauses before any state-changing tool call. The user sees exactly what the agent plans to do and must explicitly confirm. Rejection is logged and the agent explains what was attempted.
- **Enabled-tools enforcement** — the tool executor node respects the user's plugin preferences. A disabled tool cannot be executed, even if the LLM requests it — preventing crafted tool call IDs from bypassing user preferences.
- **Short-term memory** — conversation history is persisted within a session via LangGraph's `MemorySaver` checkpointer.
- **Long-term memory** — key facts about the user (risk tolerance, stated goals, financial situation) are extracted and stored in Supabase across sessions, making the agent progressively more personalised.

## 📚 RAG Pipeline

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline allows users to upload personal financial documents and ask questions about them directly in chat.

```
Upload → Process → Chunk → Embed → Store → Retrieve → Inject → Answer
```

1. **Document ingestion** — Users upload PDFs, Word documents (`.docx`), or plain text files. The document processor extracts text using `pypdf` and `python-docx`, enforcing a 20 MB file size limit and rejecting unsupported formats.

2. **Chunking** — Documents are split into overlapping chunks using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`. Chunk size and overlap are tuned to balance context preservation with retrieval precision.

3. **Embedding** — Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small`. The embedding module implements batch caching to avoid re-embedding identical content.

4. **Storage** — Embeddings are stored in **pgvector** (Supabase PostgreSQL with the vector extension) when `DATABASE_URL` is configured, with **ChromaDB** as a local fallback for development.

5. **Retrieval** — On each turn, the RAG node performs cosine similarity search against the current user's document store. A score threshold filters out low-relevance results.

6. **Injection** — Retrieved chunks are formatted and injected into the planner's context as a `## Relevant Document Context` section, scoped strictly to the current user's documents.

7. **A/B testing** — `src/rag/ab_testing.py` provides a framework for comparing retrieval strategies (different chunk sizes, embedding models, top-k values) to continuously improve retrieval quality.

---

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering

FinAdvisor AI uses a **Jinja2-templated system prompt** (`src/agent/nodes/prompts/system_prompt.json`) that is dynamically assembled on each turn with user-specific context.

### Dynamic Context Injection

| Variable | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `user_name` | Supabase users table | Personalised address |
| `preferred_currency` | User settings | All monetary values in user's currency |
| `tier` | Subscription status | Adjusts available models and features |
| `portfolio_summary` | Live portfolio query | Agent knows the user's actual holdings |
| `memories` | Long-term memory store | Facts from past conversations |
| `current_date` | Server time | Agent knows today's date for time-sensitive advice |

### Techniques Used

**1. Role and persona definition** — A clear persona (warm, professional, emoji-aware) with explicit expertise domains reduces off-topic hallucination.

**2. Tool descriptions in the prompt** — Every enabled tool is listed with a one-line description, priming the LLM to use tools proactively rather than guessing answers.

**3. Explicit behavioural rules** — A `## Conversation Rules` section handles greetings, finance questions, off-topic questions, and grey-area topics with concrete example responses for each case.

**4. Hard prohibitions** — Explicit negatives prevent the default LLM helpfulness from producing fabricated financial data:
```
"Never fabricate stock prices or financial data — always use tools"
"Never guarantee investment returns"
```

**5. Grey-area lean** — Rather than refusing ambiguous questions, the agent is instructed to lean toward answering when there is any financial angle (GDP, salary negotiation, cost of living), preventing an overly restrictive assistant.

**6. Separate RAG prompt** — The RAG node uses a distinct prompt template (`rag_prompt.json`) that instructs the model how to use retrieved document context, including citing the source document and acknowledging when the document does not answer the question.

## 🔌 Plugins System

32 tools across 10 categories, individually enable/disable on the `/plugins` page. The enabled tool list is stored per-user in Supabase and enforced at two levels: (1) the planner only receives tool descriptions for enabled tools, so the LLM cannot even request a disabled tool; (2) the tool executor node independently filters by `enabled_tools` from state as a second safeguard.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The test suite runs fully offline — no real API keys or network calls are required. All external dependencies (OpenAI, Supabase, yfinance, CoinGecko) are mocked via `unittest.mock`.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# With coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Specific test files
pytest tests/test_tools.py -v
pytest tests/test_image_tools.py -v
pytest tests/test_rag.py -v
pytest tests/test_agent.py -v
```

| File | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| `test_agent.py` | LangGraph graph compilation, node behaviour, streaming, HITL flow |
| `test_auth.py` | JWT creation/validation, password hashing, protected route access |
| `test_rag.py` | Document chunking, embedding batch caching, retrieval score filtering |
| `test_tools.py` | All financial calculation tools — ROI, compound interest, DCA, tax, planning |
| `test_image_tools.py` | Image generation — happy path, missing key, invalid inputs, all error types |

The full suite completes in under 30 seconds.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

See [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) for the complete breakdown. Summary:

**AI Disclaimer** — The system prompt explicitly instructs the AI to remind users it is not a licensed financial advisor for major decisions. This is an architectural constraint, not a UI label — it is enforced in the system prompt with: *"Disclaimer — remind users you are an AI, not a licensed advisor, for major decisions."*

**Data Privacy** — User financial data is stored in Supabase with Row-Level Security (RLS). Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. JWT tokens are short-lived (30 min) with refresh rotation. Uploaded documents are per-user and never accessible across accounts. API keys are server-side only.

**Bias Awareness** — LLMs may reflect US-centric and English-language financial biases. The app mitigates this with 20-language support (including 6 African languages), multi-currency display, and a disclosure that tax tools assume US law.

**Human-in-the-Loop** — LangGraph's `interrupt_before` pauses the agent before any state-changing action. Users must explicitly confirm before execution.

**Hallucination Prevention** — The system prompt forbids the agent from fabricating financial data. All prices, historical figures, and calculations must come from real-time tool calls.

**Rate Limiting & Security** — SlowAPI rate limits are enforced per authenticated user. Input sanitisation middleware is applied to all endpoints. Stripe webhook signatures are verified before processing.

## 📊 Evaluation Against Capstone Criteria

| Criterion | How It Is Met |
|---|---|
| **Project description (goal, problem, how it works)** | [Capstone Project Summary](#-capstone-project-summary) section above |
| **Completeness and functionality** | Full-stack app live at the demo link: FastAPI + Next.js + LangGraph agent + 32 tools + RAG + streaming + portfolio/budget/goals/alerts/billing |
| **User interface quality** | Next.js frontend: dark/light theme, 20-language support, responsive layout, real-time SSE streaming, inline image rendering |
| **LangChain usage** | `@tool` decorator, `ToolNode`, `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, document loaders, embedding wrappers |
| **LangGraph usage** | `StateGraph` with 4 nodes, conditional edges, `MemorySaver` checkpointing, `interrupt_before` HITL, `stream_mode="messages"` |
| **LLM API usage** | 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) via unified model manager; LangSmith tracing |
| **RAG implementation** | Full pipeline: ingestion → chunking → embeddings → pgvector/ChromaDB → cosine retrieval → context injection + A/B testing framework |
| **Prompt engineering** | Jinja2 system prompt with dynamic user context, tool descriptions, behavioural rules, hard prohibitions, separate RAG prompt template |
| **Ethical considerations** | [ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md) + inline section: AI disclaimer, RLS data privacy, bias acknowledgement, HITL, hallucination prevention, rate limiting |
| **Testing** | 5 pytest files, all mocked, runs offline in < 30 seconds |
| **Presentation (SCR/SMART)** | [PRESENTATION.md](PRESENTATION.md) |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Image generation requires OpenAI key** — DALL-E 3 is used regardless of active chat model; `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required even when chatting with Claude or Gemini
- **DALL-E image URLs expire** — URLs are valid for 1 hour; users should download images they want to keep
- **Tax tools assume US law** — capital gains estimator and tax bracket lookup are calibrated for US rates; international users should treat these as illustrative
- **Long-term memory is heuristic** — key fact extraction uses LLM-based heuristics and may miss nuanced preferences
- **Market data depends on third parties** — yfinance and CoinGecko may rate-limit or experience downtime; the agent reports unavailability rather than guessing
- **Crypto tickers require `-USD` suffix** — yfinance format requires `BTC-USD`, not `BTC`; the agent handles this automatically in chat
